COVID-19 Data Analysis and Visualization

This project aims to analyze and visualize COVID-19 data, focusing on key metrics such as total cases, deaths, and vaccination rates across different locations and continents. The analysis leverages SQL to query and manipulate data from COVID-19 datasets, providing insights into the impact of the pandemic on global health.


Key Features:
Data Extraction: Queries to retrieve and filter COVID-19 data, ensuring relevance and accuracy in analysis.

Statistical Calculations: Computation of important metrics such as death percentages and infection rates, with safeguards against division by zero errors.

Comparative Analysis: Examination of infection and death rates in India compared to other countries, along with global summaries.

Data Integration: Joining COVID-19 death and vaccination data to assess vaccination effectiveness.

Common Table Expressions (CTEs): Use of CTEs for modular and readable SQL queries.

Temporary Tables: Implementation of temporary tables to facilitate intermediate calculations and improve query performance.

View Creation: Establishing a SQL view for streamlined access to vaccination data for further analysis and visualization.

This project provides a comprehensive overview of how SQL can be utilized for data analysis in public health, particularly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The insights derived from this analysis can aid in understanding trends, guiding public health decisions, and supporting further research.
