COVID-19 Mortality Analysis

This project aims to analyze and visualize COVID-19 data, focusing on key metrics such as total cases, deaths, and vaccination rates across different locations and continents. The analysis leverages SQL to query and manipulate data from COVID-19 datasets, providing insights into the impact of the pandemic on global health.


Key Features:

Data Extraction: Queries to retrieve and filter COVID-19 data, ensuring relevance and accuracy in analysis.

Statistical Calculations: Computation of important metrics such as death percentages and infection rates, with safeguards against division by zero errors.

Comparative Analysis: Examination of infection and death rates in India compared to other countries, along with global summaries.

Data Integration: Joining COVID-19 death and vaccination data to assess vaccination effectiveness.

Common Table Expressions (CTEs): Use of CTEs for modular and readable SQL queries.

Temporary Tables: Implementation of temporary tables to facilitate intermediate calculations and improve query performance.

View Creation: Establishing a SQL view for streamlined access to vaccination data for further analysis and visualization.

Global Summary Visualization: Created a comprehensive overview showcasing total cases, deaths, and death percentage globally, displayed through an intuitive dashboard header for quick insights.

Continental and Country Comparisons: Visualized infection rates across continents and mapped percentage of population infected per country, providing both global and regional perspectives on COVID-19 impact.

This project provides a comprehensive overview of how SQL and Tableau can be utilized for data analysis and visualization in public health, particularly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The insights derived from SQL data processing and Tableau visualizations contribute to a deeper understanding of trends, support informed public health decisions, and offer a foundation for further research.
